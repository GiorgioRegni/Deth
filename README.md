# Deth
Deth is a Geth based Ethereum node packaged as a data Docker container that's always kept up to date with the blockchain.

## Why?

Sometimes you just want to start a quick ethereum node and don't want to wait days for the blockchain to synchronise. 
Deth solves that problem by automatically pulling the latest blocks from the chain every hour and pushing them to Docker Hub
in a way that you only need to download the increment layers and save a ton of time and bandwith.
